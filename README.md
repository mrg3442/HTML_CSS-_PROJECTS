# HTML_CSS_PROJECTS
 Repository holding all of my html and css projects from the tech academy
During this course I learned to use basic HTML tags as well how to customize pages with CSS

I worked on three major projects during the duration of this course,
1) The Space Resort where I practiced using CSS to fully customize a webpage for the first time.
2) Movie Cinema where I learned how to use bootstrap to speed up HTML and CSS webdesign.
3) My portfolio website which is made to show case some of my abilites with HTML and CSS and future projects while also serving as an about me.
